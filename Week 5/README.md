# Jupyter Notebook Project: Assignment 5

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment5.ipynb`) designed for various Python-based data processing and system-related tasks. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on setting up your environment and running the notebook.

## Features
- Date and time manipulation using the **datetime** library.
- JSON data handling with the **json** library.
- File and directory operations using the **os** library.
- Object serialization and deserialization using the **pickle** library.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- Standard library: `datetime`, `json`, `os`, `pickle`

### Installation

As the libraries used in this notebook are part of the Python standard library, no additional installations are required.

Ensure you have Python version 3.7 or higher.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Setup**:
   - Importing required libraries.
   - Preparing the environment for processing.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Handling JSON data using the `json` library.
   - Serializing and deserializing Python objects with `pickle`.

3. **System Operations**:
   - Performing file and directory manipulations using the `os` library.
   - Utilizing `datetime` for date and time-related computations.

4. **Conclusions**:
   - Final outputs and key results.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Install Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `Assignment5.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

## Notes

- Ensure your Python version is 3.7 or higher for compatibility.
- If you encounter any issues, ensure all standard libraries are functioning correctly with your Python installation.
