# Jupyter Notebook Project: Assignment 4

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment4.ipynb`) designed for Python-based data processing and system-related tasks. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on setting up your environment and running the notebook.

## Features
- Numerical computations using **NumPy**.
- Regular expressions with **re** for pattern matching.
- File and directory operations using **os** and **shutil** libraries.
- Date and time manipulation with **datetime**.
- Specialized data structures from the **collections** library.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- `numpy`
- Standard library: `collections`, `datetime`, `os`, `re`, `shutil`

### Installation

To install the required libraries, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**:

   Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your system.

2. **Install NumPy**:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

   The other libraries used in this notebook are part of Python's standard library and do not require additional installation.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Setup**:
   - Importing required libraries.
   - Preparing the environment for processing.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Numerical operations using **NumPy**.
   - Pattern matching and text processing with **re**.

3. **File and System Operations**:
   - Managing files and directories using **os** and **shutil** libraries.
   - Utilizing **datetime** for date and time-related computations.
   - Leveraging **collections** for specialized data structures.

4. **Conclusions**:
   - Final outputs and insights derived from the computations.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Install Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `Assignment4.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

## Notes

- Ensure your Python version is 3.7 or higher for compatibility.
- If you encounter any issues, ensure all required libraries are installed and functioning correctly.
