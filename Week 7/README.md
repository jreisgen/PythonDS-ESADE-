# Jupyter Notebook Project: Session 7

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`session_7.ipynb`) designed for data analysis and processing using Python. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on setting up your environment and running the notebook.

## Features
- Data manipulation and analysis with **Pandas**.
- Numerical computations with **NumPy**.
- Time-related operations using the standard Python `time` library.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- Standard library: `time`

### Installation

To set up the required environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```

   Alternatively, you can install the dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file (if available):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Setup**:
   - Importing required libraries.
   - Loading datasets or setting up initial data.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Data cleaning, manipulation, and transformation using **Pandas**.
   - Numerical computations with **NumPy**.

3. **Time-based Operations**:
   - Leveraging the `time` library for time-related tasks.

4. **Conclusions**:
   - Summary of the processed data and findings.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Install Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `session_7.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

## Notes

- Ensure your Python version is 3.7 or higher for compatibility.
- If you encounter any issues with dependencies, check the official documentation for the libraries.
